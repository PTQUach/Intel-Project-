Company Overview:
Intel, the semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse, is planning on building a new data center. Energy availability and usage are some of the key considerations in deciding on a location of the data center. For example, which regions produce a surplus of energy, and are therefore more likely to provide energy at cheaper prices?  Which regions rely more on renewable energy sources?

Business Requirements:
- Identify regions that are net energy producers
- Show how renewable energy and fossil fuels trend over time
- Aggregate new Power Plant data to locate its next data center
- Investigate how renewable energy generation fluctuates with the time of day for California and Northwest

Task 1: Identifying regions that are net energy producers
A. Which region has the highest positive total energy?
